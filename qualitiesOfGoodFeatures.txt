What are Features in Machine Learning?

They are the variables in dataset are sufficent to make a decision. 
For example: to predict house rent, size of apartment and location can be deciding factor.
Same size aparmtent in Palo Alto, California is more likely to be expensive than Toronto, Canada

Features are required as more relevant the feature is, more accuracy in the data classifier prediction.

What are the qalities of features?
1. Features should be a deciding factor and as informative as possible. Avoid those features which are not contributing in decision(kind of useless features).
2. Independent features are best. Example of dependent feature is : Height in Inches and Height in centimeters. 
   Remove highly co-related/redundant features.
3. Features should be easy to understand. time required to travel between two cities can be easier when distance is in miles 
   or kilometers as compared to predicting with both cities location given in latitude and longitude
